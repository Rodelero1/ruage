# Next step: the effect interpreter, priced from the data

Written 2026-10-26, after the resource enum and the unit roles became content (SPEC v0.54). The
question this file answers is not "what would be nice" but **what the next increment costs and what
it buys**, measured against `config/gamedata/effects.toml` rather than remembered.

## The census, re-measured

`config/gamedata/effects.toml` (generated from the user's own dat):

| | |
|---|---|
| effects | **798** |
| commands | **3,306** |
| kind 4 (add) | **1,091** |
| kind 5 (multiply) | **576** |
| kinds 4 + 5 | **1,667 — 50.4% of every command in the game's data** |
| effects made *only* of kinds 4 and 5 | **270** |
| next largest kind | 102 (tech-tree gating), 942 |

Attributes those 1,667 commands touch, most common first: **9 attack (321), 0 hp (220), 8 armour
(200), 1 range (177)**, then 23 (152), 12 (127), 13 gather rate (117), 100 (88), 5 speed (47),
10 (45). The `class` field (`b`) is `-1` — "every class" — in **1,229 of 1,667**, and the target
unit (`a`) is `-1` — "every unit" — in **440**.

## Why this is the right next increment and not a bigger one

- **Half the data, two verbs.** Kinds 4 and 5 are "add" and "multiply", and both were pinned by
  published results, not by intuition: Masonry is `[5, -1, 3, 0, 1.1]` (buildings gain 1.1× hp;
  an *addition* of 1.1 hp would be a no-op), Loom is `[4, -1, 4, 0, 15]` (+15 hp to class 4
  civilians). 270 effects contain nothing else, so they are fully unlocked by this one interpreter.
- **The engine can already receive them.** Attack and armour are resolved **when an order lands**
  (`check_attack`), not per tick, and hp is plain state. A per-player modifier table therefore
  changes what a *future* swing resolves to and what an hp total is - no new per-entity fields, and
  the modifier set belongs in the state hash beside `stock`.
- **It does not need the other 11 kinds.** Kind 102 (942 commands) is civ tech-tree gating: which
  techs a civ may research. That is a *permission* question, and it can stay unimplemented while a
  scenario researches by naming the tech directly.

## What the increment actually is

1. `Command::Research { building, tech }` — refuse in a fixed order (not a building, not finished,
   already researched, cannot afford), charge, and start a tick timer from the tech's own
   `research_time`, mirroring `Command::Train`.
2. A per-player `BTreeSet<u32>` of researched techs, hashed; upgrading a unit is *not* a state
   mutation, it is a resolution-time fact.
3. The interpreter: for each command in the tech's effect, apply add or multiply to (hp, attack,
   armour, range) for a target unit, a target class, or everything.
4. The external check: **Loom gives a villager 40 hp and Masonry gives a house 605** (550 × 1.1),
   then a spearman-vs-villager swing that lands where the published numbers say it does.

## What it explicitly does not settle

- Kind 3 (unit upgrade, 227) — a different mechanism (replace the unit id).
- Kind 2 (117) and kind 0 (106) — unresolved meanings, named in `docs/mechanics/effects.md` rather
  than guessed.
- Kind 101 (97) — U16: 13 of its ids are techs, not units, so it cannot be typed by the id.
- Anything needing a renderer.

## What the refactor before it bought

The two previous steps (resources and unit roles as content) were not preparation for its own sake:
the finish line `a_content_pack_with_our_own_resources_loads_and_spends` is a *green test* that an
original pack can price and build, the tick's cost is unchanged within noise (2.26-2.36 µs/tick at
126 entities, 27-28 ms per ten-minute match), and the four-hour run still reproduces its hash. The
effect interpreter inherits that shape directly: a tech's cost is a `Vec<Cost>` that already names
its resources, and a scenario researches a tech by **role**, both of which would have been dat ids
two commits ago.
